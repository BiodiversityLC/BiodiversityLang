Leaf Boy

Scientific name: Frondens-pueri

Often found wandering in the morning and rooted in the evening, they are easy pickings for predators due to their low stamina. They are most commonly found wandering in groups rather than by themselves.

After spotting a potential threat, they will immediately run for safety, leaving their buddies behind. They are not known for their intelligence. Due to this lack of cognitive function, they will occasionally forget about incoming danger, and they are known to rarely die due to them forgetting how to breathe.
