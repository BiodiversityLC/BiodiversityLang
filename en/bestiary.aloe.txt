The Aloe:

Scientific name: Spiculum-sana

Not dissimilarly to Rapax-folium, this species has not been able to be studied thoroughly due to their elusiveness. The one specimen to undergo study was observed to lead a hermit life style, keeping to itself and thoroughly contemplating the world around it. It appeared to have around 35 or so different spike-like protrusions on its back, which were speculated to be used to blend into bushes or tall grass; though weirdly enough, this particular specimen was found inside an abandoned electrical facility on 220-Assurance, where no similar foliage can be found.

Spiculum-sana's diet is unknown, but it is speculated they undergo some sort of "nightly photosynthesis". This was due to the specimen being spotted numerous times outside the 220-Assurance facility at night.
