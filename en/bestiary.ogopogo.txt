Scientific name: Macrobdella-rostrata

Thought to have gone extinct more than six hundred years ago, these cave-dwelling macro-leeches have somewhat recently shown back up around the Green Witches. Not much is known about their biology, but they seem to lack eyesight and hearing, along with always having multiple smaller Macrobdella-rostrata swimming around them. Two of them have never been spotted in proximity to each other before or after their reappearance.

The first reported sighting of Macrobdella-rostrata was in 1926 when a mining company accidentally hit a water deposit deep below the ground, where a lone specimen was living out its last days. Subsequent sightings seemed to confirm they only inhabited underground water deposits, but in 2830 a clew of their young was spotted feeding on an unidentified creature's carcass at the bottom of a lake.
Old stories from mining expeditions speak of their long, tendril-like snouts which they used to feel around for prey inside caves; even so, they seemed unbothered by the presence of humans and appeared passive around most creatures.

They have been recently discovered to be quite territorial and extremely protective of their young, so it is advised to stay away from their nests and to never sit still for too long.

No dead specimens have ever been found.
